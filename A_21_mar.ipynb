    "\"\"\"Ordinal encoding is a technique for encoding categorical data into numerical data where the categories are assigned unique integer values based on their order or rank. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"education level\" with categories \"high school\", \"college\", and \"graduate school\", we can assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to these categories based on their rank, respectively. This encoding assumes that there is a natural order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, is a technique for encoding categorical data into numerical data where each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with categories \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\", we can assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to these categories, respectively. This encoding does not assume any order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "One scenario where we might choose ordinal encoding over label encoding is when we have a categorical variable where there is a natural order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"income bracket\" with categories \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\", we can assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to these categories based on their order, respectively. This encoding would be appropriate since there is a natural order among the income brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we might choose label encoding over ordinal encoding when there is no natural order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"fruit\" with categories \"apple\", \"orange\", and \"banana\", we can assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to these categories, respectively. This encoding would be appropriate since there is no natural order among the fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the difference between ordinal encoding and label encoding is that ordinal encoding assumes a natural order or hierarchy among the categories, while label encoding does not.

We then assign a unique numerical value to each category based on its order in the ranking. This way, the encoding captures the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, and helps the machine learning algorithm to make more accurate predictions.\n",

Suppose we have a dataset containing information about customers of an e-commerce website, including their gender and purchase behavior (i.e., whether they made a purchase or not). We want to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their gender.\n",

Let's say that the mean purchase rate for male customers is 0.3 and the mean purchase rate for female customers is 0.6. We would then order the categories based on the mean purchase rate, with \"female\" being the highest and \"male\" being the lowest. Finally, we would assign a unique numerical value to each category based on its order in the ranking, with \"female\" being assigned 2 and \"male\" being assigned 1.\"\"\""
