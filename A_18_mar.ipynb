    "\"\"\"Embedded feature selection methods are techniques that perform feature selection as part of the model training process. In embedded methods, feature selection is performed while training the model, and the selected features are used to build the final model. Some common techniques used in embedded feature selection methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a linear regression technique that performs feature selection by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which forces the coefficients of some features to become zero. The features with non-zero coefficients are selected for the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that adds a regularization term to the cost function, which helps to reduce the effect of collinearity among the features. Ridge regression can be used for feature selection by setting the coefficients of some features to be small or close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net: Elastic Net is a combination of Lasso and Ridge regression, which helps to overcome some of the limitations of both techniques. Elastic Net adds both L1 and L2 regularization terms to the cost function, which allows for feature selection and helps to reduce the effect of collinearity among the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees: Decision trees are a non-linear technique that can be used for feature selection by selecting the most informative features at each split in the tree. Features that do not contribute significantly to the classification task are pruned from the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosted Trees: Gradient Boosted Trees are an ensemble learning technique that can be used for feature selection by training multiple decision trees and selecting the most informative features at each split in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks: Neural Networks are a powerful machine learning technique that can be used for feature selection by adding a regularization term to the cost function, which helps to reduce the effect of redundant or irrelevant features. The regularization term encourages the network to learn a sparse representation of the input data.\"\"\""
