    "A) Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and language translation. AI involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A chatbot that can understand and respond to natural language inputs, helping customers to resolve their issues without the need for human intervention. Another example is self-driving cars that use AI-powered computer vision to detect obstacles, traffic signals, and pedestrians, enabling them to navigate roads safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. In other words, the computer \"learns\" from the data and adjusts its algorithms to improve accuracy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An image recognition system that can recognize different objects in photos or videos. Initially, the system is trained on a dataset of labeled images, and the machine learning algorithm learns to identify patterns and features that distinguish different objects. Once trained, the system can recognize new images and classify them into different categories with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms can learn to recognize patterns and features in data with many layers of abstraction, enabling them to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A deep learning system that can recognize faces in photos or videos. The system uses a neural network with many layers to identify features such as edges, curves, and textures that are unique to each person's face. By analyzing these features, the system can recognize and identify different individuals with high accuracy, even in complex or varied environments.\n",
