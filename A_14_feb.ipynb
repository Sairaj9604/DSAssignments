    "Resource sharing: Threads within a process can share the same resources such as memory, files, and network connections. This makes it easier to \n",

    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive to user input while performing long-running tasks in the background. \n",

    "\n",
    "Scalability: Multithreading can help improve the scalability of a program by allowing it to utilize multiple CPUs or cores.\n",

    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can increase the complexity of a program, as developers need to carefully manage thread synchronization and avoid \n",
    "race conditions that can lead to bugs and program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource contention: When multiple threads access the same resources simultaneously, contention can occur, leading to performance degradation \n",
