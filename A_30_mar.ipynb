    "\"\"\"Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression model that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques to handle the limitations of each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, Elastic Net Regression adds a new regularization term to the linear regression model that combines the penalties of Lasso and Ridge regression. This regularization term includes two hyperparameters, alpha and lambda, which control the balance between L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, Elastic Net Regression has the advantage of reducing overfitting, handling collinearity among predictor variables, and selecting the most relevant features for the model. It is especially useful when the number of predictor variables is high and some of them are highly correlated, leading to unstable estimates of regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other regression techniques, such as linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression, only use one type of regularization, which may not be suitable for all types of datasets. Linear regression does not perform any regularization and can easily overfit the data. Lasso regression selects only a subset of relevant predictors but may not perform well when predictors are highly correlated. Ridge regression shrinks all the regression coefficients, but may not perform well when a few predictors are highly relevant.\n",

    "Bayesian Optimization: Bayesian optimization involves using a probabilistic model to search for the optimal values of alpha and lambda by balancing the exploration and exploitation of the parameter space.
