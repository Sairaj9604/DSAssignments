Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?
Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset and is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset is roughly symmetrical and does not have any extreme outliers.

Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are ordered from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest). The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset has extreme outliers or is skewed.

Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset has a discrete or categorical variable.

Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the
central tendency of a dataset?

Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset and is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset is roughly symmetrical and does not have any extreme outliers.

Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are ordered from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest). The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset has extreme outliers or is skewed.

Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset has a discrete or categorical variable.

Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:
[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
Mean = (178 + 177 + 176 + 177 + 178.2 + 178 + 175 + 179 + 180 + 175 + 178.9 + 176.2 + 177 + 172.5 + 178 + 176.5) / 16
Mean = 1769.8 / 16
Mean = 110.61375

Median = (177.5 + 178) / 2
Median = 177.75

There is no value that occurs more than once in the dataset, so there is no mode.

Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:
[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]

the standard deviation of the data is  16.1162

Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe
the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.

The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of the spread of the data but is sensitive to outliers.

The variance and standard deviation are more robust measures of dispersion that take into account the deviation of each data point from the mean. The variance is calculated as the average squared deviation from the mean, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. A higher variance or standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out, while a lower variance or standard deviation indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean.
Q6. What is a Venn diagram?
A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between different sets or groups. It consists of overlapping circles (or other shapes) that represent the sets, with the overlapping regions indicating the elements that belong to both sets. The diagram was invented by John Venn in the late 19th century and has since become a popular tool in mathematics, statistics, and other fields that deal with set theory.
Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:
(i) A ⋂ B
(ii) A ⋃ B

1.  A ⋂ B - {2,6}

2.  A ⋃ B - {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}

Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?
Skewness in data refers to the degree of asymmetry of a distribution. A distribution is said to be skewed if it is not symmetrical around its mean. In a symmetrical distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same value, while in a skewed distribution, these measures of central tendency are different.

Skewness can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of the skew. Positive skewness occurs when the tail of the distribution extends to the right, meaning that there are more values on the left side of the mean than on the right side. Negative skewness occurs when the tail of the distribution extends to the left, meaning that there are more values on the right side of the mean than on the left side. A distribution with no skewness is called a symmetric distribution.

Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?
If a data is right skewed, meaning the tail of the distribution is on the right side, the median will be less than the mean. This is because the mean is pulled in the direction of the long tail, which has more extreme values, while the median is the value that divides the data into two equal halves, regardless of the extreme values in the tail.

For example, suppose we have a dataset of exam scores with a mean of 75 and a median of 70. If the data is right skewed, it means that there are more low scores on the left side of the distribution and a few high scores on the right side. In this case, the mean is pulled to the right by the high scores, making it higher than the median, which is unaffected by the extreme values. Therefore, in a right-skewed distribution, the median is usually smaller than the mean.

Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?

Covariance is a measure of how two variables vary together. It is calculated by taking the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means and then averaging those products. Covariance can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the direction and strength of the relationship between the variables. However, covariance does not provide information about the strength or direction of the relationship between the variables, as it is affected by the scale of the variables.

On the other hand, correlation is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation takes values between -1 and 1, with a correlation coefficient of +1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicating no correlation. Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables, and it is not affected by the scale of the variables.

Both covariance and correlation are used in statistical analysis to understand the relationship between two variables. However, correlation is generally preferred over covariance because it is a standardized measure that provides information about the strength and direction of the relationship, regardless of the scale of the variables. Covariance is useful in some situations, such as in portfolio analysis in finance, where it is used to measure the risk and return of different assets.


Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a
dataset.

mean -
x̄ = (Σ xi) / n

4, 7, 10, 13, 16
x̄ = (4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + 16) / 5 = 10
Therefore, the sample mean for this dataset is 10.

Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?

For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal and located at the center of the distribution. This means that the measures of central tendency are all the same value.

This is because a normal distribution is symmetric around the center, and the mean is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the total number of values, while the median is the middle value in the dataset, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value.

Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the mean, median, and mode are all located at the center of the distribution, and are therefore equal.

Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?
Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together. It is calculated as the average of the products of the deviations of each value from their respective means. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions. However, the magnitude of the covariance is dependent on the scale of the variables, and therefore cannot be compared across datasets with different units.

Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized version of covariance. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, and ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship, a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, and a correlation of 0 indicates no relationship. Unlike covariance, correlation is scale-invariant and can be compared across datasets with different units.

Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.
Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion, as they can pull the values of the mean, variance, and standard deviation in the direction of the outlier.

For example, consider a dataset of exam scores: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, and 100. The mean of this dataset is 82.5, and the standard deviation is 11.4. However, if an outlier score of 50 is added to the dataset, the mean drops to 75, and the standard deviation decreases to 16.3. This is because the outlier has pulled the values towards the lower end of the distribution.
