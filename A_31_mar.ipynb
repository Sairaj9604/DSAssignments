This involves selecting a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and configuring the necessary resources such as virtual machines, load balancers, and databases. The application is then deployed to the cloud platform using tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, or serverless computing.\n",

    "\"\"\"Infrastructure: In traditional web hosting, a website or application is hosted on a single physical server or a cluster of servers maintained by the hosting provider. In contrast, cloud hosting uses a network of virtual servers that are spread across multiple physical servers, usually located in different geographical locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Traditional web hosting is limited by the resources available on a single physical server, which can lead to performance issues or downtime during high traffic periods. On the other hand, cloud hosting allows for easy scalability, as additional virtual servers can be added to the network as needed to handle increased traffic or demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: Traditional web hosting typically involves a fixed cost for a certain amount of storage, bandwidth, and other resources. In contrast, cloud hosting is based on a pay-as-you-go model, where users pay only for the resources they use. This makes cloud hosting more cost-effective for small to medium-sized websites or applications with fluctuating traffic levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability: Cloud hosting is typically more reliable than traditional web hosting, as it uses redundant servers and network infrastructure to ensure high availability and uptime. Traditional hosting, on the other hand, may have a single point of failure, such as a single physical server, which can lead to downtime or data loss in the event of a hardware failure or other issue.\"\"\""
